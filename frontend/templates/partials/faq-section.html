                                <div class="faq-card-a">AWM Institute of Technology is an interactive learning platform designed to help you master GitHub Copilot, Stratos, and SmartSDK. Through hands-on modules, visual walkthroughs, and a built-in coach, you'll gain practical skills you can apply immediately.</div>

                                <div class="faq-card-q">Do I need coding experience to get started?</div>
                                <div class="faq-card-a">Not at all. Modules start at the beginner level and walk you through everything step by step. Whether you're technical or not, each module is designed so you can follow along at your own pace — no prior tool-specific experience needed.</div>
                            </div>

                                <div class="faq-card-q">What tools will I learn?</div>
                                <div class="faq-card-a">The platform covers three core tools: GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted code generation, SmartSDK for building AI-powered features into applications, and Stratos for workflow automation and deployment. Each tool has dedicated beginner-to-advanced modules.</div>

                                <div class="faq-card-q">How long does each module take?</div>
                                <div class="faq-card-a">Each section takes just a few minutes. Modules are short, concise, and to the point — designed for you to learn and grow across different difficulty levels at your own pace.</div>

                                <div class="faq-card-a">Yes, completely. Every module is available on-demand — watch the video walkthroughs, pause, replay, and go at whatever speed works for you. No deadlines, no schedules, no pressure. Just open a module and start learning.</div>

                                <div class="faq-card-a">Every module has a built-in coach that can answer your questions in context while you watch. The videos are broken into focused sections with timestamps, so you're not scrubbing through hour-long recordings trying to find what you need. It's structured, it's searchable, and it's built around real tools you'll actually use.</div>

There's also a standalone chat on the platform for general questions. If you need more, reach out through the contact page and we'll get back to you.</div>
